smCore and SMF 3.0 repository

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository holds smCore, SMF 3.0, auth module, and other modules needed to build SMF 3.0.
By installing it, you should get a complete installation of SMF 3.0, plus a few development tools, such as an external library used as unit testing framework.


smCore
------

smCore repository is a Simple Machines project designed to be the core framework upon which SMF 3.0 is being built. The library will be included in SMF 3.0.

This software is being developed with an Open Development model, driven by the SMF community and contributors.

SMF 3.0 will also be developed with an Open Development model, using both Github tools and home-installed tools.

Goals:
The smCore project will be working to develop a platform for development of future versions of SMF, allowing easy interaction with other large modules such as a blog, portal or CMS, gallery, and other large and desirable parts, of a community-based website.

Currently, many of these things are hacked onto the forum and live as second-class citizens on your website. But SMF developers had always envisioned a set of website "simple machines" to do most of the hard work of the forum and all the other essential pieces of your community-based website.

What is smCore?
smCore will be a "core" of reusable code that will provide the basis for the development of future versions of SMF.

What smCore is not
smCore will not do anything all on its own, but provide the core functions upon which SMF functionalities are being built.

For more information about SMF future, please refer to the development blog: http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=469381.0

**How to Contribute**

Code contributions are always welcome. We're developing using the fork and pull request model as per GitHub practice. Please check out: [Pull requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests)
* Fork the repository, and clone it
* Commit, as many times as you need to achieve the desired result
* Sign-off your commits, to certify the changes are under the license of the project, as per: [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/SimpleMachines/smCore/blob/master/DCO.txt)
* Push your changes to your repository, ideally to a branch, dedicated to the issue
* Create a pull request to the main repository

Most of the actual work will be done in personal repositories, before being hashed out and merged in the official repository.

Installation requirements:
- PHP 5.3+
- Database support: currently tested on MySQL, with MySQLi or PDO. Character set: UTF8. The target is to support multiple database systems, among which PostgreSQL 9+.

Instructions:
- The file core_tables.sql from the main directory contains the queries to be executed for installation. Todo: add the install script, and migration from SMF 2.0.

- The file Settings.php from the /other directory contains the settings for the installation. Customize it as needed, and copy it on your setup in the main directory.

More details:
In the main directory there is a file Database changes from SMF, being... what it says it is, surprisingly. ;) The file 'specs' is just a quick todo file, to be removed and replaced with proper specifications, documented for the respective modules (it's not exactly smCore itself).
